# Engineering

Mattify engineering skills gather decisions for RFCs, implement Approved RFCs, and support independent engineering tasks.

## User-invoked

Reachable only when you type them (Claude Code: `disable-model-invocation: true`; Codex: `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml`).

- **[ask-matt](./ask-matt/SKILL.md)**: Ask which skill or flow fits your situation. A router over the user-invoked skills in this repo.
- **[grill-with-docs](./grill-with-docs/SKILL.md)**: Grilling session that also builds your project's domain model, sharpening terminology and updating `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs inline.
- **[triage](./triage/SKILL.md)**: Move issues through a state machine of triage roles.
- **[improve-codebase-architecture](./improve-codebase-architecture/SKILL.md)**: Scan a codebase for deepening opportunities, present them as a visual HTML report, then grill through whichever one you pick.
- **[setup-mattify-skills](./setup-mattify-skills/SKILL.md)**: Check this repo's `.spec/` setup and route initialization or consistency checks to host-installed `/specify`.
- **[to-spec](./to-spec/SKILL.md)**: Compatibility entry point that delegates RFC creation and lifecycle to host-installed `/specify`.
- **[to-tickets](./to-tickets/SKILL.md)**: Break an Approved RFC into implementation slices while keeping the RFC as scope authority.
- **[implement](./implement/SKILL.md)**: Implement work from an Approved RFC, using `/tdd` at agreed seams and `/code-review` before completion.
- **[implement-spec](./implement-spec/SKILL.md)**: Implement an Approved RFC across an integration branch, tracking task dependencies and closing with `/code-review`.
- **[wayfinder](./wayfinder/SKILL.md)**: Clarify large, uncertain efforts and hand settled decisions to host-installed `/specify` for an RFC hierarchy.
- **[retro](./retro/SKILL.md)**: Suggest improvements to the coding agent's environment (navigation, automated checks, coding standards, steering files, tooling) after a session, most severe first.

## Model-invoked

Model- or user-reachable (rich trigger phrasing so the model can reach for them).

- **[prototype](./prototype/SKILL.md)**: Build a throwaway prototype to answer a design question: a single shareable HTML file for state/logic, or several toggleable UI variations.

- **[diagnosing-bugs](./diagnosing-bugs/SKILL.md)**: Disciplined diagnosis loop for hard bugs and performance regressions: build a feedback loop that goes red on this bug → minimise → hypothesise → instrument → fix → regression-test.
- **[research](./research/SKILL.md)**: Investigate a question against high-trust primary sources and capture the findings as a cited Markdown file in the repo, run as a background agent.
- **[tdd](./tdd/SKILL.md)**: Test-driven development with a red-green-refactor loop. Builds features or fixes bugs one vertical slice at a time.
- **[domain-modeling](./domain-modeling/SKILL.md)**: Actively build and sharpen a project's domain model by challenging terms, stress-testing with scenarios, and updating `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs inline.
- **[codebase-design](./codebase-design/SKILL.md)**: Shared discipline and vocabulary for designing deep modules: small interfaces, clean seams, testable through the interface.
- **[code-review](./code-review/SKILL.md)**: Two-axis review of the diff since a fixed point: **Standards** (does it follow the repo's coding standards, plus a Fowler smell baseline?) and **Spec** (does it faithfully implement the originating issue/spec?), run as parallel sub-agents.
- **[pr](./pr/SKILL.md)**: The shape a pull request body should take: a summary as the smallest visual that makes the change clear, before/after evidence that it works, and a merge-danger call (one-way or two-way door, plus blast radius).
- **[wizard](./wizard/SKILL.md)**: Generate an interactive bash wizard that walks a human through steps only they can perform: provisioning infrastructure, setting up credentials or CI secrets, walking an unfamiliar third-party dashboard, or running a one-off migration or cutover.
